It’s a topic that has come up in several places, and it's one that I think is worth considering. I’ve written before about the nature of wholeness and its importance to our understanding of the world, but the relationship between the two has always been something that I've wanted to explore more.\n\nThe way I see it, there are two main ways in which we can view the relationship between a whole and its parts. The first is that the whole is made up of the parts. In this view, the whole is simply the collection of all of the parts. In a way, this is a very literal interpretation, and one that is certainly easy to understand. We can break something down into its component parts, and those will be the parts that make up the whole. In a way, this is an example of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. That is, the whole is not just the collection of the parts, but rather the combination of the parts. The second view is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. In this view, the whole is more than just the parts. The whole is not just a collection of the parts",
